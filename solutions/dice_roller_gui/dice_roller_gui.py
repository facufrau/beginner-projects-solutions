Bonus:
    You are about to play a board game, but you realize you don't have any dice.
    Fortunately you have this program.
    Create a program that opens a new window and draws 2 six-sided dice
    Allow the user to quit, or roll again
    Allow the user to select the number of dice to be drawn on screen(1-4)
    Add up the total of the dice and display it
